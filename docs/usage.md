A [novelibre](https://github.com/peter88213/novelibre/) plugin providing synchronization with Aeon Timeline 2. 

---

# Installation

- Unzip the downloaded zipfile into a new folder.
- Move into this new folder and launch **setup.pyw**. This installs the plugin.

*Note: If you install novelibre at a later time, you can always install the plugin afterwards by running the nv_aeon2 setup script again.*

The plugin adds an **Aeon Timeline 2** entry to the *novelibre* **Tools** menu, and an **Aeon 2 plugin Online Help** entry to the **Help** menu. 

## Install the Aeon Timeline 2 custom themes

After installation, you can copy a "novelibre" template to the
Aeon2 custom template folder. The easiest way is to create new
timelines based on this template. It provides the entities and event
properties that are converted to novelibre by default.

If you click on the **Open the Aeon2 custom template folder**
button, two Explorer windows will open: the **sample** source folder,
and the ``AppData\Local\Scribble Code\Aeon Timeline 2\CustomTemplates``
target folder. Just drag the template files you need from the source
folder into the target folder. The next time you start *Aeon Timeline 2*, 
the new template appears in the *Custom Templates* area.
