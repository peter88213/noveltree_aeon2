A [noveltree](https://peter88213.github.io/noveltree/) plugin providing synchronization with Aeon Timeline 2. 

---

# Installation

- Unzip the downloaded zipfile into a new folder.
- Move into this new folder and launch **setup.pyw**. This installs the plugin.

*Note: If you install noveltree at a later time, you can always install the plugin afterwards by running the noveltree_aeon2 setup script again.*

The plugin adds an **Aeon Timeline 2** entry to the *noveltree* **Tools** menu, and an **Aeon 2 plugin Online Help** entry to the **Help** menu. 

---

# Operation

---

## Launch the converter

The plugin's features are accessible via the **Tools > Aeon Timeline 2** submenu in *noveltree*.

The submenu has the following entries:

- Information (compare noveltree and timeline file dates)
- Update timeline from noveltree
- Update noveltree from timeline
- Add or update moon phase data
- Edit timeline (launch Aeon Timeline 2)

---

# Control conversion

---

## Prepare your timeline for export

The included installation script installs a "yWriter" template in the *aeon2nv* configuration folder. 
The easiest way is to create new timelines based on this template. It provides the entities and event properties that are converted to noveltree by default.

For existing timelines you have two choices:

- Option 1: Add or rename the required entities and event properties in the Timeline settings.
- Option 2: Customize the *aeon2nv* configuration to fit your timeline, see [Custom configuration](#custom-configuration).

---

## Synchronization in detail

### Known limitations

- "Narrative" events that begin before 0100-01-01 in the timeline, will not be synchronized with noveltree, because noveltree can not handle these dates.
- The same applies to the section duration in this case, i.e. the event duration in Timeline and the section duration in noveltree may differ.

### Conversion rules for newly created noveltree projects

The names/column labels refer to timelines based on the "yWriter" template. 

- If an Aeon event title occurs more than once, the program aborts with an error message.
- Events assigned to the "Narrative" arc are converted to regular sections (*).
- Optionally, events not assigned to the "Narrative" arc are converted to "Notes" sections (**).
- New sections are put into a new chapter named "New sections". 
- All sections are sorted chronologically. 
- The section status is "Outline". 
- The event title is used as section title (*).
- The start date is used as section date/time, if the start year is 100 or above.
- The section duration is calculated, if the start year is 100 or above.
- Event tags are converted to section tags, if any (*).
- "Descriptions" are imported as section descriptions, if any (*).
- "Notes" are used as section notes, if any (*).
- "Participants" are imported as characters, if any (*).
- "Locations" are imported, if any (*).
- "Items" are imported, if any (*).

### Update rules for existing noveltree projects

- Only sections that have the same title as an event are updated.
- If an Aeon event title occurs more than once, the program aborts with an error message.
- If a noveltree section title occurs more than once, the program aborts with an error message.
- Sections are marked "unused" if the associated event is deleted in Aeon.
- Section date, section time, and section duration are updated.
- Non-empty section description and section tags are updated.
- Notes of events with a matching title are appended to the section notes.
- The start date is overwritten, if the start year is 100 or above.
- The section duration is overwritten, if the start year is 100 or above.
- New "Normal" type sections are created from "Narrative" events, if missing (*).
- Optionally, new "Notes" type sections are created from non-"Narrative" events, if missing (**).
- New sections are put into a new chapter named "New sections". 
- New arcs, characters, locations, and items are added, if assigned to "Narrative" events.
- Arc, character, location, and item relationships are updated, if the entity names match.
- When processing unspecific "day/hour/minute" information, a reference date that can be set in the configuration is used.


### Update rules for Aeon Timeline 2 projects

- If an Aeon event title occurs more than once, the program aborts with an error message.
- If a noveltree section title occurs more than once, the program aborts with an error message.
- Event date/time and event span are updated, if the start year is 100 or above.
- Updated event span is specified in days/hours/minutes as in noveltree.
- Non-empty event description and event tags are updated.
- Event properties "Description" and "Notes" are created, if missing.
- Events created or updated from "Normal" sections are assigned to the *Narrative* arc (*).
- "Narrative" events are removed if the associated section is deleted in noveltree.
- Optionally, events are created or updated from "Notes" sections (not assigned to the *Narrative* arc)(**).
- Entity types "Arc", "Character", "Location", and "Item" are created, if missing.
- A "Narrative" arc is created, if missing.
- A "Storyline" arc role is created, if missing.
- New arcs, characters, locations, and items are added, if assigned to sections.
- Arc, character, location, and item relationships are updated, if the entity names match.
- When creating events from sections without date/time, they get the actual date and are sorted in reading order.
- When creating events from sections without any date/time information, they get the default date from the configuration, and are sorted in reading order.
- When processing unspecific "day/hour/minute" information, a reference date that can be set in the configuration is used.

(*) Applies to the default configuration, but can be customized.

(**) To be set in the configuration file.

## Custom configuration

You can override the default settings by providing a configuration file. Be always aware that faulty entries may cause program errors. 

### Global configuration

An optional global configuration file can be placed in the configuration directory in your user profile. It is applied to any project. Its entries override aeon2nv's built-in constants. This is the path:
`c:\Users\<user name>\.noveltree\config\aeon2nv.ini`
  
### Local project configuration

An optional project configuration file named `aeon2nv.ini` can be placed in your project directory, i.e. the folder containing your noveltree and Aeon Timeline project files. It is only applied to this project. Its entries override aeon2nv's built-in constants as well as the global configuration, if any.

### How to provide/modify a configuration file

The aeon2nv distribution comes with a sample configuration file located in the `sample` subfolder. It contains aeon2nv's default settings and options. You can copy this file to the global configuration folder and edit it.

- The SETTINGS section mainly refers to custom property, role, and type names. 
- Comment lines begin with a `#` number sign. In the example, they refer to the code line immediately above.

This is the configuration explained: 

```
[SETTINGS]

default_date_time = 2023-01-01 00:00:00

# Date/time used for new events and for converted events
# where the section has no date/time information at all.
# The date is also used as a reference when converting 
# unspecific section "days" into event dates.
# The format must be yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
# If the format is invalid, the current date/time is used instead.

narrative_arc = Narrative

# Name of the user-defined "Narrative" arc.

property_description = Description

# Name of the user-defined section description property.

property_notes = Notes

# Name of the user-defined section notes property.

role_location = Location

# Name of the user-defined role for section locations.

role_item = Item

# Name of the user-defined role for items in a section.

role_character = Participant

# Name of the user-defined role for characters in a section.

type_character = Character

# Name of the user-defined "Character" type

type_location = Location

# Name of the user-defined "Location" type

type_item = Item

# Name of the user-defined "Item" type

color_section = Red

# Color of new section events

color_event = Yellow

# Color of new non-section events

[OPTIONS]

sections_only = Yes

# Yes: Create new sections from "narrative" events only.
# No: Additionally create "Notes sections" from "non-narrative" events.

add_moonphase = No

# Yes: Add the moon phase to the event properties.
# No: Update moon phase, if already defined as event property.
```

Note: Your custom configuration file does not have to contain all the entries listed above. 
The changed entries are sufficient.
