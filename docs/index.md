## Features

- Update section date, time, duration, description, tags, and relationships.
- Missing sections, characters, locations, and items are created.
- Sections are marked "unused" if the associated event is deleted in Aeon.

### Update an existing timeline from a noveltree project

- Update event date, time, duration, description, tags, and relationships.
- Entity types "Arc", "Character", "Location", and "Item", and a *Narrative* arc are created, if missing.

- Missing events, characters, locations, and items are created.
